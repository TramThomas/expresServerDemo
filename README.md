# Working with JavaScript APIs Course

This course will teach you how to write, use, and consume REST APIs in JavaScript. This course assumes the following as prerequisite knowledge:
 
* Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript
* Use of the Browser DOM
* Use of database CRUD transactions
* Basics of Node.js

A REST API is a way of easily accessing web services. When a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource. A RESTful API is stateless, separates concerns between client-server, allows caching of data client-side and it utilizes standardized base URLs and methods to perform the actions required to manipulate, add, or delete data.
